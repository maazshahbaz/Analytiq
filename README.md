# ✨ Analytiq – Unlock Insights from Unstructured Data

Analytiq is an AI-powered platform built for Institutional Research (IR) departments to transform how they work with data. It allows teams to effortlessly upload thousands of unstructured and semi-structured files—including PDFs, spreadsheets, and reports—and turn them into a powerful, searchable knowledge base.

With natural language querying, users can talk to their documents, extract precise information, identify trends, and generate deep analysis without the need for manual digging. Whether you're working on accreditation reports, enrollment trends, or institutional performance metrics, Analytiq helps you get the answers faster.

Once insights are generated, results can be downloaded in multiple formats such as CSV, Excel, or PDF—streamlining your workflow and supporting data-driven decision-making.
